                        <p class="text-white">To relevant customer journeys, you need to understand your customers as best and as fully as you can. Data is the vehicle for that. However, with the amount of data now available, it can cause as many problems as it solves.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">B2B marketers have access to more data than we could ever possibly use. Because of this, being able to effectively read and interpret data is increasingly becoming a differentiator. Slight adjustments and customisations made off the back of data can have big impacts on performance as a whole.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">We’ve had a lot of practice. Our clients range from headcounts of 10 to 10,000 and span four core industries. We work across the marketing, development and creative spectrum so being data literate is important as we finely tune recommendations to ensure our clients are in pole position.</p>

                    <p class="text-white">Ensure any links pointing to your company’s website from external marketing assets (email, organic or paid social ads, banners on 3rd party websites, etc) are tracked. Create your tracked link using <strong>Google URL Builder</strong>.</p>
                    <p class="text-white">Tracked data will flow into Google Analytics where you will be able to see how many visits came from your marketing activity and what those people did on your website.</p>

                    <p class="text-white">Google Analytics does not track all website visitor actions by default, leaving you in the dark as to whether your site visitors are doing what you want them to do.</p>
                    <p class="text-white">For most B2B websites, the winning strategy is for the visitor to fill in a contact lead form, click on a contact email address or download a pdf.  Use <strong>Google Event Tracking</strong> to record these visitor actions and send this additional tracking data to Google Analytics.</p>
                </div>

            <div id="section3" class="art-section">
                <div class="content-box">
                    <p class="text-white">Google Event Tracking can be implemented through hard-coding by your website developer, but marketeers can add the event tracking code to the site themselves by creating a <strong>Google Tag Manager</strong> account for your website. This can also be used to create any conversion tags you may want to generate through paid advertising platforms, such as LinkedIn or Twitter.</p>

                <div class="content-box">
                    <p class="text-white"><strong>Naming conventions</strong> are important. Try to standardise the way you label your links, events or campaign names. It will make your life much easier when it comes to reporting and enable your colleagues to make sense of it should they need to access it.</p>

                    <p class="text-white">Set-up <strong>Goal Conversions in Google Analytics</strong> to enable easy performance comparison across all your channels, campaigns and audience sets. Set up goals for all key visitor actions – form submits, downloads, video plays, outbound clicks to any website sub-domains.</p>

            <div id="section6" class="art-section">
                <div class="content-box">
                    <p class="text-white">Take time <strong>to learn what the different metrics actually tell you</strong> in Google Analytics and the various ad platforms. By default, not always the most useful metrics are offered, so learn what they mean and pick the right one for your objectives.</p>
                    <p class="text-white">For example, Avg Session Duration is commonly used to gauge visitor engagement levels but is far from an accurate metric. No time is recorded for one-page visits as Google has no end point against which to track time. Ditto the last page view of a multi-page visit is not included in the session time, which for a site with long blog articles, could lead to misleading session times.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="section7" class="art-section">
                <div class="content-box">
                    <p class="text-white">Understand what metrics are vital for your business. While bounce rates and session times are useful in measuring site visitors, <strong>cost per conversion (CPC)</strong> is the best metric for comparing performance across various channels. You may notice that your ads on LinkedIn had a conversion rate of 15% and the same ads on Twitter, a 5% conversion rate, however, as cost-per-click tends to be much higher on LinkedIn so Twitter is the more cost-effective channel.</p>

            <div id="section8" class="art-section">
                <div class="content-box">
                    <p class="text-white"><strong>Segment your audiences,</strong> both when analysing performance of your site visitors and also when targeting people through paid media campaigns. At the simplest level, this could be separating out prospective new audiences against those who have visited your website already and are therefore further along in the decision-making process.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="section9" class="art-section">
                <div class="content-box">
                    <p class="text-white">Take advantage of the wealth of the <strong>demographic data</strong> available in Google Analytics or the segment options in Google Ads or Facebook. It will show you, for example, which age group the visitor was in or where they were located. If visitors from certain cities or countries are not converting on your site, you should focus your budget on reaching just those in the places that do.</p>
                </div>

            <div id="section10" class="art-section">
                <div class="content-box">
                    <p class="text-white">When running paid campaigns, <strong>don’t try to test too much</strong>, as it will prevent you from understanding what works. <strong>Employ a testing strategy</strong> and test one element at a time. For example, use two different ads with the same ad copy. Draw a conclusion based on results as to which image worked better for your audience and then move on to your second test – the winning image with two different sets of ad copy.</p>

                        <p>82% of B2B marketers said that managing the volume, variety and velocity of data is moderately to extremely challenging. Executing these tips will make it easier to focus on what matters.</p>
                        <p>Always remember, data is only half the story; context is everything – combined with the data, it’s what provides tangible and actionable insights. You could spend hours veering towards so-called interesting data that, when it comes down to it, means little to nothing for your business. Instead of chicaning through the data obstacle course, take the direct route to the chequered flag.</p>
                        <p>Always start with questions. What are the key answers your data should be providing and what are you going to use it for?</p>
